Predict click-through rates on display ads (`Link`__)

Display advertising is a billion dollar effort and one of the central uses of machine learning on the Internet. 
However, its data and methods are usually kept under lock and key. In this research competition, CriteoLabs is 
sharing a weekâ€™s worth of data for you to develop models predicting ad click-through rate (CTR). Given a user 
and the page he is visiting, what is the probability that he will click on a given ad?

You can find the data used in this demo in the path ``/demo/classification/criteo_ctr/``.
