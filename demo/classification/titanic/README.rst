This challenge comes from the Kaggle. In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people 
were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers 
survived the tragedy. (`Link`__)

You can find the data used in this demo in the path ``/demo/classification/titanic/``.
