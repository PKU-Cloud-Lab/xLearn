xLearn Command Line Usage
------------------------------

For Training: ::

    xlearn_train <train_file_path> [OPTIONS]

Options: ::

  -s <type> : Type of machine learning model (default 0)
     for classification task:
         0 -- linear model (GLM)
         1 -- factorization machines (FM)
         2 -- field-aware factorization machines (FFM)
     for regression task:
         3 -- linear model (GLM)
         4 -- factorization machines (FM)
         5 -- field-aware factorization machines (FFM)
                                                                           
  -x <metric>          :  The metric can be 'acc', 'prec', 'recall', 'f1', 'auc' (classification), and
                          'mae', 'mape', 'rmsd (rmse)' (regression). On defaurt, xLearn will not print
                          any evaluation metric information.                                           
                                                                                                     
  -p <opt_method>      :  Choose the optimization method, including 'sgd', adagrad' and 'ftrl'. On default,
                          we use the adagrad optimization.
                                                                                                
  -v <validate_file>   :  Path of the validation data file. This option will be empty by default,
                          and in this way, the xLearn will not perform validation.
                                                                                             
  -m <model_file>      :  Path of the model checkpoint file. On default, the model file name will be.
                          set to 'train_file' + '.model'. If we set this value to 'none', the xLearn will
                          not dump the model checkpoint after training.
  -t <txt_model_file>  :  Path of the txt model checkpoint file. On default, this option is empty
                          and xLearn will not dump the txt model. For now, only the bias and linear term
                          will dump to the txt model checkpoint file.
                                                                            
  -l <log_file>        :  Path of the log file. Using '/tmp/xlearn_log/' by default.
                                                                                      
  -k <number_of_K>     :  Number of the latent factor used by fm and ffm tasks. Using 4 by default.
                          Note that, we will get the same model size when setting k to 1 and 4.
                          This is because we use SSE instruction and the memory need to be aligned.
                          So even you assign k = 1, we still fill some dummy zeros from k = 2 to 4.
                                                                                         
  -r <learning_rate>   :  Learning rate for stochastic gradient descent. Using 0.2 by default.
                          xLearn uses adaptive gradient descent (AdaGrad) for optimization problem,
                          and the learning rate will be changed adaptively.
                                                                                    
  -b <lambda_for_regu> :  Lambda for L2 regular. Using 0.00002 by default. We can disable the
                          regular term by setting this value to 0.0
                                                                     
  -u <model_scale>     :  Hyper parameter used for initialize model parameters.
                          Using 0.66 by default.
                                                                                 
  -e <epoch_number>    :  Number of epoch for training. Using 10 by default. Note that, xLearn will
                          perform early-stopping by default, so this value is just a upper bound.
                                                                                       
  -f <fold_number>     :  Number of folds for cross-validation. Using 5 by default.     
                                                                                     
  --disk               :  Open on-disk training for large-scale machine learning problems.
                                                                   
  --cv                 :  Open cross-validation in training tasks. If we use this option, xLearn
                          will ignore the validation file (-t). 
                                                                  
  --dis-lock-free      :  Disable lock-free training. Lock-free training can accelerate training but
                          the result is non-deterministic. Our suggestion is that you can open this flag
                          if the training data is big and sparse.
                                                                       
  --dis-es             :  Disable early-stopping in training. By default, xLearn will use early-stopping
                          in training tasks, except for training in cross-validation.
                                                                                         
  --no-norm            :  Disable instance-wise normalization. By default, xLearn will use
                          instance-wise normalization for both training and prediction.
                                                                 
  --quiet              :  Don't print any evaluation information during the training and
                          just train the model quietly.

  -alpha               :  Used by ftrl.
                                       
  -beta                :  Used by ftrl.
                                       
  -lambda_1            :  Used by ftrl.
                                       
  -lambda_2            :  Used by ftrl.

For Prediction: ::

    xlearn_predict <test_file> <model_file> [OPTIONS]

Options: ::

  -o <output_file>     :  Path of the output file. On default, this value will be set
                          to 'test_file' + '.out'
                                                      
  -l <log_file_path>   :  Path of the log file. Using '/tmp/xlearn_log' by default.
